# Diabetic-Retinopathy-project
üëÅÔ∏è Diabetic Retinopathy Detection | Deep Learning An AI-powered solution that detects and classifies diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Trained on the APTOS2019 dataset, this project aims to assist in early diagnosis, helping prevent vision loss through timely medical intervention.
# ü©∫ Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
A CNN model built with **TensorFlow** + **Keras** to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.  
Trained on the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset.
